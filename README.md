# Rot13-Decryption
Rot13-decryption

This is for decrypting rot13, this will accept letters and rotate them 13 characters, as far as I have tested, any character (other than spaces) can be input, anything a-z will be shifted by 13, special characters will be kept the same.
Spaces in the input will only encrypt / decrypt up to the first space.
